About
This is a boilerplate app Erik Rasmussen started in 2015, later KÃ©vin Berthommier and Dong Cai maintained, and improved,and then it's been under my growth as of 2018 putting together and using the following technologies in a very crafty way to make "lightning fast." a reality.

* [Universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) rendering
* Both a client and a seperate API server making simultaneous calls.

* [Express](http://expressjs.com)
* [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com/) (based on express and websockets, fast!)
* [Passport](http://passportjs.org), [feathers-authentication](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication) and [redux-auth-wrapper](https://github.com/mjrussell/redux-auth-wrapper) for authentication

* [React Router Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) Redux/React Router bindings.
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org) to maintain a consistent code style
