About
This is a boilerplate app Erik Rasmussen started in 2015, later KÃ©vin Berthommier and Dong Cai maintained, and improved,and then it's been under my growth as of 2018 putting together and using the following technologies in a very crafty way to make "lightning fast." a reality.

Universal rendering
Both a client and a seperate API server making simultaneous calls.
React
React Router
Express
Feathers (based on express and websockets, fast!)
Passport, feathers-authentication and redux-auth-wrapper for authentication
Babel for ES6 and ES7 magic
Webpack for bundling
Webpack Dev Middleware
Webpack Hot Middleware
Redux's futuristic Flux implementation
Redux Dev Tools for next generation DX (developer experience). Watch Dan Abramov's talk. (Check the browser extension for chrome as well)
React Router Redux Redux/React Router bindings.
ESLint to maintain a consistent code style
redux-form to manage form state in Redux
lru-memoize to speed up form validation
multireducer to combine single reducers into one key-based reducer
style-loader, sass-loader and less-loader to allow import of stylesheets in plain css, sass and less,
semantic-ui-react
font-awesome
react-helmet to manage title and meta tag information on both server and client
webpack-isomorphic-tools to allow require() work for statics both on client and server
Jest to allow writing unit tests for the project.
